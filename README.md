# Responsive-Portfolio
Homework 2 - Responsive Portfolio

Responsive Portfolio was easier for me to grasp than the Bootstrap one. I will definitely need some instruction on how to achieve that assignment with Bootstrap. I may go in with the demo starter file and work on it that way. 

There are still some tweaks I was not able to get perfect but I began understanding towards the end and will continue to practice so I am fluent in it.
